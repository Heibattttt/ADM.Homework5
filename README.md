## Overview
This notebook provides a solution to find the most efficient routes between cities using a flight network dataset. It calculates the shortest paths based on distance, processes the data, and visualizes the results.

## Features
- Constructs a directed graph from the flight network dataset.
- Finds the best routes (shortest by distance) between airports in specified cities for a given date.
- Handles cases where no route is available and reports it.
